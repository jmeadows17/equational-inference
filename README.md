# equational-inference
Repo for the "Similarity-based equational inference in physics" paper.

Although the experiment from the paper is described fully by the Equational_Inference_Full_Experiment notebook
and the PhysAI-DS1.csv dataset, it is messy and difficult to read.

To mitigate this, I have uploaded two separate supporting notebooks highlighting the Computer Algebra Derivation
and the core Search Algorithm (which is effectively pseudocode without its Full_Experiment context).
